				<p><img src="badjao ii.jfif" class="picRight3"/><br><br><br>To understand what the project is all about, we need to provide some information on what the Badjao Community Association of Matina Aplaya (or BCAMA) is and what their main issue is. <br><br>
The BCAMA was founded by Pastor Felicisimo “Jun” Morales, a pastor that was empathetic and compassionate to the Badjao, even coming to the point of having to live at a Badjao community with his wife. <br><br>
The advocacy of the BCAMA is simple, better living conditions and more representation for the Badjao, or at least, their Badjao community, however, not everything has been great for the BCAMA and its Badjao community. <br><br>
As of the making of this webpage, the Badjao community currently faces a lack of materials for their school, the reason as to why this is happening is due to marginalization. It, has made education for the BCAMA hard to do. <br><br>
Which is why we want to provide them a solution, which can provide the school enough funds and encourage students to learn more.</p>

			<h2>Project Mudan</h2>
				<p><br><br><br> Our project proposal (a.k.a Project Mudan) is a project that aims to provide the BCAMA Badjao Community's public school an entirely new source of income and food through the establishment of an urban farm, along with teaching children agribussiness (business relating to agriculture), simple economics and botany. 
The BCAMA Badjao Community, from what we have heard from them is that they want children to learn about business, so it would be great to introduce them to agribusiness, and by establishing a farm, not only would they know how to treat the farm, but also have actual experience in the future. <br><br> 
We even expect that after the project ends with the farm being established, the farm could be expanded, which would then increase output for exports and consumption. <br><br>
The project is expected to start and end at around mid November up to mid January, with a total budget of P2000, so not only is the project a great idea, but also a cheap idea as well (considering how expensive it is in creating traditional and urban farms), the farm, as stated, will be donated to the public school most of the children are educated in.
<br><br>"How is it significant to me or to you?" Well, there is an answer to that question, and we will answer said question.</p><br><br>
<p>Below here, there is a button named "Profit Calculations", it provides the calculations of how much revenue the school would earn from the farm, along with a few more proposals. Project Mudan is very significant to not only the BCAMA and its Badjao community, but to us advocates and to you, the person reading this right now, or in general, the public, everyone.<br><br>

			<h2>The BCAMA Perspective</h2>
				<p><br> For the BCAMA, Project Mudan was made specifically for them, and through extensive research, we concluded that Project Mudan can be very helpful to the BCAMA and its Badjao Community in the long term.
The project aims to teach children agribusiness and establish a farm, that will not only enhance the children's understanding of business (in general), but the farm planned out for them will bring about a new industry, other than fishing and pearl gathering.
Although there are already plans in making farms inside the BCAMA, the farm could improve the school, that the children are being taught in.</p>
			
			<h2>The Atenean Perspective</h2>
<p><br> For us Ateneans, we really just do this out of pure goodwill and compassion for the BCAMA and its Badjao Community, they have a very meaningful advocacy, and we genuinely want to help.
We have the moral obligation to help others in need, without any sort of reward, other than a feeling of fulfillment and joy for them, we were also taught the Christian way of moral life, where God commands us to do good for others, providing them unconditional love and support, which further enhanced that obligation for it was meaningful spiritually.
As stated, we really don't earn anything from proposing (and hopefully) doing Project Mudan, but at least we can help the BCAMA and its Badjao Community in every way we can.</p>

			<h2>Your Perspective</h2>
<p><br>When it comes to you, the viewer, and generally the public, we hope this project can inspire those to do the same as we have done, maybe not for the BCAMA, but to other institutions like it.
Our project could serve, as stated, inspiration, that people, regardless of whatever circumstance, can still advocate about a meaningful cause. 
Our project could garner attention, more people would of know what is happening to the BCAMA and there could be some people that would actually like to help in helping the BCAMA.
There are probably thousands of advocacy projects that are pretty much similar, but what makes each of them special is that they really are meaningful, as they try to bring to us all the reality of what some people face in their lives.
We hope, that to you and to the public, that this is not merely an advocacy page for the BCAMA and its Badjao Community, but as inspiration.</p>

<p><br>From the claims and evidence we have given, Project Mudan is the best choice for the BCAMA, as it has the potential to change the BCAMA and its Badjao Community.</p>
