		This is our video, although the information said is a bit outdated, this video was really for the BCAMA, 
		to bring awareness to the issues they face and a show of how much we (the group) want to help them in their mission.</p>

		<h2>Pearls Through a Sewer Pipe</h2>
		<p> <img src="https://s4.gifyu.com/images/thesource-2.png" style="width:265px" vspace="10" hspace="10" align="left"/> <br><br><br>Pearls Through a Sewer 
		Pipe is a digital painting created by one of our members, Annie Palmiery, and is heavily inspired by The Source by Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres, and Girl 
		With a Pearl Earring by Johannes Vermeer. It is made to represent the struggles of the Badjao Community to maintain their traditional form of livelihoods, 
		fishing, and pearl gathering, amidst industrialization and urbanization.</p>
		<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
		<h2>Rhyne's Homicide</h2>
		<p> <img src="https://s4.gifyu.com/images/palmiery_Jogues.jpg" style="width:265px" vspace="10" hspace="10" align="right"/> <br><br><br>Rhyne’s Homicide 
		is another painting created by Annie. It depicts the conflict of reason, morality, and consciousness, through the eyes of a forbidden love between a 
		goddess who is cursed to kill whoever she touches, and a  mortal who is so blinded by love, even towards a monster like her. The piece is heavily 
		influenced by the sculpture Psyche Awakened by Cupid’s Kiss by Antonio Canova, and the song, Romantic Homicide by Dav4d. Art prints of this piece 
		will be made to sell for our research mobilization in our third quarter.</p>

	<img src="https://s4.gifyu.com/images/slay2.jpg" style="width:500px" vspace="10" hspace="10"/> <br><br><br>These pictures were taken during 
	the representative’s visit to the community, where   a member of ours went and discussed our plan with a head of the community. Through this we were able
	to get a very useful insight into what the community truly needs. Because of this, we are able to further adjust our plans accordingly to ensure that the 
	Badjao community is given the utmost importance and value for our project.
