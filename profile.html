		<h2>The Institution's Background</h2>
		<p>
		The Badjao live by the shores of Borneo, Mindanao, Celebes and Indonesia, and as such,
their main source of income would be fish. However, fish is not enough for the Badjao as other factors
would come into play, such as the government restricting fishing spots to preserve fish, along with
other environmental concerns such as typhoons and waste management. It would be this bad, that people
from Badjao communities started looking for opportunities in cities, such as Manila, Davao, and etc.
Thus, under the guidance of Pastor Felicisimo “Jun” Morales, the Badjao Community Association of
Matina Aplaya Inc. was created. The person who founded the Badjao Community Association of Matina Aplaya Inc.
was Pastor Felicisimo “Jun” Morales, a pastor who was interested in the Badjao. Pastor Jun wanted
to help the Badjao and at the same time understand them, so he went to Isla Verde and with his wife,
lived there for 8 years. He had gained the trust and respect of the Badjao community of Isla Verde;
after much sincerity, he and his wife opened clinics. He had then founded the Badjao Community
Association of Matina Aplaya Inc., in hopes of making the community a model for the Badjao community.
He then left, making Ruben Ladyawan, a Badjao native and self taught artist, the chairman of the Badjao
Community Association of Matina Aplaya Inc.</p>

			<h2>Beneficiaries and Benefactors</h2>
				<p>The beneficiaries of the Badjao Community Association of Matina Aplaya Inc. are the Badjao. There
are many other types of Badjao subgroups all across the shores of Borneo, Mindanao, Celebes and
Indonesia, but the people that come to the Badjao Community Association of Matina Aplaya Inc. are
mainly nearby. Some of them might be from the Samal or East Coast Bajau subgroups. The beneficiaries
are not just Badjao but people, who are in dire need of help, and want the best for themselves and
their families and by the efforts of the Badjao Community Association, they are able to find the
help and necessities that they need.
There are two known primary benefactors, mainly the local government and the Ateneo de Davao
University. The local government, as the government, is mainly responsible for them, the local
government provides the necessary help needed to the Badjao Community Association of Matina Aplaya
Inc., such as helping in providing healthcare, education and family planning. The Ateneo de Davao
University, as its main mission to help those in Mindanao, aims to help the Badjao Community
Association of Matina Aplaya Inc. in their goal of helping Badjao communities. The Ateneo de Davao
University would initiate projects such as Project GypSEAS, a project focused on teaching Badjao
communities their own cultural heritage, teaching adults agriculture and educating children.</p>
