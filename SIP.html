			<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
			<h3>Composting and the Community</h3>
				<p><img src="heart dirt.jpg" width="300" height="200" vspace="10" hspace="10" align="right"><br><br><br>Composting is valuable to both communities and the environment as it provides a 
				win-win situation for us humans, and for our earth. For one, the obvious reason is that compost can become fertilizer to help plants grow by 
				enriching the soil with the vitamins needed for plant growth and repelling diseases to ensure that the plant (vegetables in this context) grows 
				nice, well, and healthy. Not only this, but it helps the environment by putting biodegradable stuff like food waste to good use, and it helps to 
				establish vegetation in areas that may be lacking such, and can help with reducing water runoff from rainwater and such. And to add an extra point
				focusing your attention on taking care of plants within your area or perhaps in a small green space, you wish to have, you are promoting good air
				quality within your community.</p>

			<h2>The significance of the study</h2>
				<h3>Why we do it and why its important</h3>
				<p><img src="spinach.jpg" style="width:300px" vspace="15" hspace="15" align="center"/><br><br><br>
				Spinach is known to boost the immune system which is great to combat infections from wounds acquired from fishing and ear 
				infections which is a problem that Badjao fishermen who have ruptured their eardrums in order to dive with ease, encounter from time to time. 
				It promotes cardiovascular and respiratory health which is perfect for spending long minutes underwater. It helps to prevent osteoporosis which, 
				as you can imagine, swimming with weak, trypophobia-inducing bones is less than ideal. And finally, it boosts hydration, which is essential for
				spending long periods of time exposed to saltwater that may dry out the skin.</p>

			<h2>The BCAMA Perspective</h2>
				<p>	<img src="egg w plant.webp" width="300" height="200" vspace="10" hspace="10" align="center"><br><br><br> As for our choice of fertilizer to experiment with, we chose to experiment with eggshell fertilizer, 
				which can be simply made by crushing the shells and then boiling them, after which we cover it for a week, opening it once
				a day to stir it. Then we pour the mixture onto the soil. Eggshells contain lots of calcium which helps plants in absorbing 
				nutrients which is vital to plant growth. As a fertilizer, it can lower acidity in soil as many plants grow better in less acidic 
				soils. It also encourages root growth and wards off pests. Another reason why we chose eggshells is that they are cost-efficient with 
				the average price of 1 egg being Php 3-6.
<br><br>
				Considering that we also wish to keep things space efficient too, we are testing this with another set-up wherein the growing spinach 
				will be grown mainly under the presence of an LED in order to see which method would be more beneficial in growing the spinach. We try
				to keep the experiment as cost-effective and beneficial for the health of the community as much as possible.</p>
				
			<h2>The Experiment</h2>
				<h3>A deeper dive into the project</h3>
<p><img src="sunlight.png" width="600" height="400" vspace="10" hspace="10" align="center"><br><br><br><br>
 Let us take a look at our setups for the experiment. As we have established, we will be experimenting with the effects of eggshell 
fertilizer, mainly between natural light (sunlight) and LED lights. To make sure the experiment succeeds, we will keep things as controlled as
 possible. Examples of such include the amount and type of soil used to plant the spinach in, the size of the container they will be grown in, 
 the amount and type of water they will receive, the amount and type of spinach we will use, and the time allotted for it to grow in each set-up.
 At the end of the experiment, we will measure the size of the spinach leaves as well as the vegetables' height. Therefore we have hypothesized 
 that if spinach is grown in sunlight with eggshell fertilizer, then it will grow better.</p>
